Description	
------------
  
This package contains a set of tools for the manipulation of data extracted from binary files
A binary file contains a sequence of records with the following fields:
• Product name [52 bytes].
• Weight [8 bytes]: value between 0.0 and 1000.0
• Reference [4 bytes]: value between 0 and 1000.
• Stock [4 bytes]: value between 0 and 1000.

Tools

bin2text	
  
Converts a binary file to a text file. Each line in the text file 
represents a product. The
fields of a product record are separated by a tabulator (‘\t’).
Use: ./bin2text <binary file> <text file>
  
text2bin	
  
Converts the text file to the binary file.
Use:./text2bin <text file> <binary file>
	
  
statistics	
  
Displays the following statistics about a binary file.
Products with high availability (H): 500 <= stock <= 1000.
Products with medium availability (M): 100 <= stock < 500.
Products with low availability (L): 0 <= stock < 100
Example:
H: 38%
M: 42%
L: 20%
Use:./statistics <binary file>


combine	
  
Merges two binary file into a third file.
Use:./combine <binary file 1> <binary file 2> <output binary
file>
	

split	
  
Splits a binary file into two binary files with half number of products.
Use: ./split <input binary file> <out binary file 1> <output
binary file 2>
filter	
  
Filters products according with stock. The filter is represented through 
a char [H, M ,L]:
H: high availability.
M: medium availability.
L: low availability.
Use: ./filter [filter] <binary input file> <binary output
file>
